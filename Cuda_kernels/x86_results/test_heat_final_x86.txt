This kernel launch is configured to execute 2      \n          threads per block. Consequently, some threads in a warp are masked off and those hardware resources are       \n          unused. Try changing the number of threads per block to be a multiple of 32 threads. Between 128 and 256      \n          threads per block is a good initial range for experimentation. Use smaller thread blocks rather than one      \n          large thread block per multiprocessor if latency affects performance.

Try changing the number of threads per block to be a multiple of 32 threads. Between 128 and 256      \n          threads per block is a good initial range for experimentation. Use smaller thread blocks rather than one      \n          large thread block per multiprocessor if latency affects performance.

This kernel launch is configured to execute 16     \n          threads per block. Consequently, some threads in a warp are masked off and those hardware resources are       \n          unused. Try changing the number of threads per block to be a multiple of 32 threads. Between 128 and 256      \n          threads per block is a good initial range for experimentation. Use smaller thread blocks rather than one      \n          large thread block per multiprocessor if latency affects performance.  This is particularly beneficial to     \n          kernels that frequently call __syncthreads().
