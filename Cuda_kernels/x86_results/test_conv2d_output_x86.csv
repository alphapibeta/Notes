          Threads are executed in groups of 32 threads called warps. This kernel launch is configured to execute 16     
          threads per block. Consequently, some threads in a warp are masked off and those hardware resources are       
          unused. Try changing the number of threads per block to be a multiple of 32 threads. Between 128 and 256      
          threads per block is a good initial range for experimentation. Use smaller thread blocks rather than one      
          large thread block per multiprocessor if latency affects performance.  This is particularly beneficial to     
          kernels that frequently call __syncthreads(). See the Hardware Model
