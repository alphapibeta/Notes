## Theoretical Background

### Hessian Matrix

The Hessian matrix is a square matrix of second-order partial derivatives of a scalar-valued function. For a function f(x1, ..., xn), the Hessian is given by:

```
H = [∂²f/∂xi∂xj]
```

where i and j denote row and column indices respectively.

### Matrix Inversion

Matrix inversion is the process of finding the matrix A^(-1) such that AA^(-1) = A^(-1)A = I, where I is the identity matrix. For a Hessian matrix, its inverse is used in various optimization algorithms.

### LU Decomposition

LU decomposition is a matrix factorization technique that decomposes a matrix A into the product of a lower triangular matrix L and an upper triangular matrix U:

A = LU

This decomposition is useful for solving linear systems and inverting matrices efficiently.

Steps of LU decomposition:
1. Initialize L as identity matrix and U as zero matrix
2. For each row i and column j:
   a. Calculate U[i][j] = A[i][j] - Σ(L[i][k] * U[k][j]) for k < i
   b. Calculate L[j][i] = (A[j][i] - Σ(L[j][k] * U[k][i])) / U[i][i] for j > i

Time complexity: O(n^3) for an n×n matrix

## Implementation Details

### CPU Version (HessianInversionCPU)

The CPU implementation uses LU decomposition for matrix inversion. Key steps:

1. LU decomposition
2. Forward substitution
3. Backward substitution

```cpp
template <typename T>
void HessianInversionCPU<T>::invert() {
    std::vector<std::vector<T>> L(size, std::vector<T>(size, 0));
    std::vector<std::vector<T>> U(size, std::vector<T>(size, 0));
    luDecompose(L, U);
    for (int i = 0; i < size; ++i) {
        std::vector<T> e(size, 0);
        e[i] = 1;
        std::vector<T> y = forwardSubstitution(L, e);
        std::vector<T> x = backwardSubstitution(U, y);
        for (int j = 0; j < size; ++j) {
            inverse[j][i] = x[j];
        }
    }
}
```

### GPU Version (HessianInversionGPU)

The GPU implementation leverages CUDA and the cuSOLVER library for efficient matrix operations. Key steps:

1. Memory allocation on GPU
2. cuSOLVER's getrf for LU factorization
3. cuSOLVER's getrs for solving the system

```cpp
template <>
void HessianInversionGPU<float>::invert() {
    int lwork = 0;
    float* d_work = nullptr;
    CHECK_CUSOLVER(cusolverDnSgetrf_bufferSize(cusolverH, size, size, d_matrix, size, &lwork));
    CHECK_CUDA(cudaMalloc(&d_work, lwork * sizeof(float)));
    CHECK_CUSOLVER(cusolverDnSgetrf(cusolverH, size, size, d_matrix, size, d_work, d_ipiv, d_info));
    // ... (error checking and solving)
    CHECK_CUSOLVER(cusolverDnSgetrs(cusolverH, CUBLAS_OP_N, size, size, d_matrix, size, d_ipiv, d_inverse, size, d_info));
    // ... (error checking and cleanup)
}
```

## Precision Analysis

We implemented a hybrid comparison method to analyze the differences between CPU and GPU results:

```cpp
template <typename T>
bool compareMatricesHybrid(const vector<vector<T>>& cpu_matrix, const vector<T>& gpu_matrix, int size, T abs_tolerance = 1e-5, T rel_tolerance = 0.01) {
    int mismatches = 0;
    T max_abs_diff = 0;
    T max_rel_diff = 0;
    T sum_abs_diff = 0;
    T sum_rel_diff = 0;

    for (int i = 0; i < size; ++i) {
        for (int j = 0; j < size; ++j) {
            T cpu_val = cpu_matrix[i][j];
            T gpu_val = gpu_matrix[i * size + j];
            T abs_diff = std::abs(cpu_val - gpu_val);
            T rel_diff = abs_diff / std::max(std::abs(cpu_val), std::abs(gpu_val));
            
            sum_abs_diff += abs_diff;
            sum_rel_diff += rel_diff;

            if (abs_diff > abs_tolerance && rel_diff > rel_tolerance) {
                mismatches++;
                max_abs_diff = std::max(max_abs_diff, abs_diff);
                max_rel_diff = std::max(max_rel_diff, rel_diff);
                // ... (reporting first 5 mismatches)
            }
        }
    }

    // ... (calculating and reporting averages)
    return mismatches == 0;
}
```

This function calculates:
- Total mismatches
- Maximum absolute difference
- Maximum relative difference
- Average absolute difference
- Average relative difference

### Analysis of Precision Issues

1. IEEE 754 Standard:
   - Float (32-bit): 1 sign bit, 8 exponent bits, 23 fraction bits
   - Double (64-bit): 1 sign bit, 11 exponent bits, 52 fraction bits

2. Precision Limitations:
   - Float: ~7 decimal digits of precision
   - Double: ~15-17 decimal digits of precision

3. Error Propagation:
   Example: Adding a small number to a large number in float precision
   ```
   float a = 1000000.0f;
   float b = 0.1f;
   float c = a + b;
   printf("%.1f\n", c - a);  // Outputs 0.0, not 0.1
   ```

4. Matrix Inversion Sensitivity:
   - Each operation in LU decomposition and substitution steps can introduce small errors
   - These errors compound through the calculation, leading to significant discrepancies in the final result

5. GPU vs CPU Differences:
   - Different order of operations due to parallelization
   - Potential differences in rounding methods between CPU and GPU
